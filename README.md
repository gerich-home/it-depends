# it-depends
Lightweight dependency tracking / caching library for JavaScript

## About the library
**it-depends** library is a lightweight general purpose dependency tracking library that helps you organize your JavaScript code using the approach to build a model proposed in [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/computedObservables.html)

**it-depends** does not worry about UI - it is solely for managing dependencies between data/model elements.

The key point in using the library is to define as less **state values** as possible and define the rest of the model as **computed values**, based on them.

All computed values are **lazy** and **cacheable**. It means that if you define the computed value based on other values it is not calculated immediately.

The calculation function **will be called** on the **first** attempt to read the value.

The calculation function **will not be called** immediately after the value of any dependency is changed.
You **must read** the value again to trigger the execution of calculation function.

## When to use?
Your code has quite a little state and a lot of values that can be computed from this state.

Your aim is to have easy to test, debug and maintain self-describing pieces of code **without side effects**.
You are OK with building code that way (it looks similar to [Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)).

You have some state that should be calculated on demand only and you do not want to clutter your code with additional caching logic.

You use a framework (such as AngularJs) that is responsible for rendering the model on the screen **or** you manage rendering by yourself (either by subscribing to the changes in desired values like it is done in KnockoutJS or by running event loop like it is done in AngularJS).

## History
I created the library when I was refactoring one of complex screens in an [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) application.

The corresponding UI code contained logic to handle the checked/unchecked state of checkboxes mixed with the quite complex business rules for calculating whether the checkbox is enabled or disabled (based on the checked/unchecked state).

The code was slow because for any (even unrelated to checkboxes) change on UI Angular restarted `$digest` loop and required the checked and enabled states.
I preferred to do not use `$scope.$watch` to update values on change in checked/unchecked state, because I did not want to clutter my scope with implementation details of intermediate values, I wanted to always have some exact state (without intermediate transition states, when some values were updated and some of them - not) and I did not want to manage dependencies manually.

I refactored code to extract these calculation functions into small pieces, implicitly declared dependencies between them, so the framework became able to handle both dependencies and caching for me.

After that I allowed AngularJS to query my `$scope` so that it could get actual values from observable values and cached computed. 

## Installation and usage

#### [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)

```
npm install it-depends --save
```

In your application include the module and use it:
```javascript
var itDepends = require('it-depends');

// your code goes here:
var firstName = itDepends.value('James');
...
```

#### [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD)/[RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/gerich-home/it-depends/releases)

Place where it is suitable according to your AMD/RequireJS configuration

Use it as a dependency of AMD module:
```javascript
define(['it-depends'], function(itDepends) {
    // your code goes here:
    var firstName = itDepends.value('James');
    ...
});
```

#### Browser globals

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/gerich-home/it-depends/releases)

Place where it is suitable

Include it into the page:
```html
<script src="js/ext/it-depends.js"></script>
<script src="js/your-application.js"></script>
```

You will be able to use `itDepends` global variable in your-application.js:
```javascript
// your code goes here:
var firstName = itDepends.value('James');
...
```

## API

Find API documentation [here](docs/README.md)

## Example code ([Try it in Tonic](https://tonicdev.com/gerichhome/it-depends))
```javascript
var firstName = itDepends.value('James');
var lastName  = itDepends.value('Bond');

var fullName = itDepends.computed(function(){
    return 'Hello, ' + firstName() + ' ' + lastName();
});

console.log(fullName()); // Hello, James Bond

firstName.write('Jack');

console.log(fullName()); // Hello, Jack Bond
```

## Contributing
I will be glad if you will join the development.

There are lot of things you can help me with. Here are few of them:
* Enhance documentation / write samples
* Raise/discuss/prepare PRs for [improvements/issues](https://github.com/gerich-home/it-depends/issues)
* Add more [unit tests](https://github.com/gerich-home/it-depends/tree/master/specs)
* Help me with publishing to different repositories, automate it: npm, Bower, NuGet
* Move to TypeScript / write typings
* Make library known to publicity
