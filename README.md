Lightweight dependency tracking / caching library for JavaScript

## About the library
**it-depends** library is a lightweight general purpose dependency tracking library that helps you organize your JavaScript code using the approach to build a model proposed in [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/computedObservables.html)

**it-depends** does not worry about UI - it is solely for managing dependencies between data/model elements.

The key point in using the library is to define as less **state values** as possible and define the rest of the model as **computed values**, based on them.

All computed values are **lazy** and **cacheable**. It means that if you define the computed value based on other values it is not calculated immediately.

The calculation function **will be called** on the **first** attempt to read the value.

The calculation function **will not be called** immediately after the value of any dependency is changed.
You **must read** the value again to trigger the execution of calculation function.

## When to use?
Your code has quite a little state and a lot of values that can be computed from this state.

Your aim is to have easy to test, debug and maintain self-describing pieces of code **without side effects**.
You are OK with building code that way (it looks similar to [Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)).

You have some state that should be calculated on demand only and you do not want to clutter your code with additional caching logic.

You use a framework (such as AngularJs) that is responsible for rendering the model on the screen **or** you manage rendering by yourself (either by subscribing to the changes in desired values like it is done in KnockoutJS or by running event loop like it is done in AngularJS).

## History
I created the library when I was refactoring one of complex screens in an [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) application.

The corresponding UI code contained logic to handle the checked/unchecked state of checkboxes mixed with the quite complex business rules for calculating whether the checkbox is enabled or disabled (based on the checked/unchecked state).

The code was slow because for any (even unrelated to checkboxes) change on UI Angular restarted `$digest` loop and required the checked and enabled states.
I preferred to do not use `$scope.$watch` to update values on change in checked/unchecked state, because I did not want to clutter my scope with implementation details of intermediate values, I wanted to always have some exact state (without intermediate transition states, when some values were updated and some of them - not) and I did not want to manage dependencies manually.

I refactored code to extract these calculation functions into small pieces, implicitly declared dependencies between them, so the framework became able to handle both dependencies and caching for me.

After that I allowed AngularJS to query my `$scope` so that it could get actual values from observable values and cached computed. 

## Installation and usage

#### [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)

```
npm install it-depends --save
```

In your application include the module and use it:
```javascript
var itDepends = require('it-depends');

// your code goes here:
var firstName = itDepends.value('James');
...
```

#### [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD)/[RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/gerich-home/it-depends/releases)

Place where it is suitable according to your AMD/RequireJS configuration

Use it as a dependency of AMD module:
```javascript
define(['it-depends'], function(itDepends) {
    // your code goes here:
    var firstName = itDepends.value('James');
    ...
});
```

#### Browser globals

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/gerich-home/it-depends/releases)

Place where it is suitable

Include it into the page:
```html
<script src="js/ext/it-depends.js"></script>
<script src="js/your-application.js"></script>
```

You will be able to use `itDepends` global variable in your-application.js:
```javascript
// your code goes here:
var firstName = itDepends.value('James');
...
```

## API

### `itDepends`
The single entry point exported by a library. Defined on the global scope when script is included via `<script>` tag.

### `itDepends.value(initialValue)`

Creates observable value object.

#### Parameters:
* `initialValue` *(optional, any value, undefined by default)* - the value to be stored in the observable when created.

#### Returns:
Type: `observableValue`.
The observable value object.

### `observableValue()`
Reads the current value of observable value object.

#### Returns:
Type: `any`.
The current value of observable value object.

### `observableValue.write(newValue)`
Updates the current value of observable value object.

#### Parameters:
* `newValue` *(mandatory, any value)* - the new value to write to observable value object.

#### Returns:
Type: `void`.

### `observableValue.onChange(callback)`
Creates the subscription on a change to this observable value.

#### Parameters:
* `callback` *(mandatory, function (changed: observableValue, from: any, to: any) -> void )* - the function that will be called immediately when a change is made to this observable value. The callback receives the changed observableValue, old and new value of observable object.

#### Returns:
Type: `subscription`.
The subscription object that can be used to control the subscription.

### `itDepends.computed(calculator, writeCallback)`
Creates computed value object.

#### Parameters:
* `calculator` *(mandatory, function (...parameters: any[]) -> any)* - the function that will be called later to (re)calculate the value of computed. Gets called when you request the value for the first time, or when you request the value when some of dependencies (values/computeds) was changed. Should return(calculate) the current value of the computed value object. **Must not** have side-effects. Calculator function can take parameters. In this case the resulting computed behaves as a set of elementary computeds bound to each distinct set of arguments. These individual computeds can be accessed with `withArgs` and `withNoArgs` methods.
* `writeCallback` *(optional, function (newValue: any, parameters: any[], self: `computedForArgs`) -> void)* - the function that will be called when `write` method is called. New value is passed into a method plus parameters information is passed as an array along with the computed value being modified.

#### Returns:
Type: `computedValue`.
The computed value object.

### `computedValue(...parameters)`
Reads the current value of computed value object for the given set of parameters. `calculator` will be called if it is the first call or if a change was made to some of the dependencies (values/computeds) called from calculator previous time. Otherwise the cached current value will be returned.
During the call dependencies (values/computeds) used in the calculator will be recorded and stored in the list of dependencies.

#### Parameters:
* `parameters` *(varadic, any[])* - parameters that will be passed to the `calculator`. Calculator will be called only once for each unique set of parameters unless dependencies are changed. Trailing `undefined` values are dropped.

#### Returns:
Type: `any`.
The current value of computed value object for the given parameters.

### `computedValue.write(newValue)`
Calls write callback for the computed passing empty arguments set.

#### Parameters:
* `newValue` *(mandatory, any value)* - the new value to write to computed object.

#### Returns:
Type: `void`.

### `computedValue.onChange(callback)`
Creates the subscription on a change to this computed value with no arguments.

#### Parameters:
* `callback` *(mandatory, function (changed: computedValueForArgs, from: any, to: any, args: any[]) -> void )* - the function that will be called immediately when a change is made to one of dependencies that leads to a change of computed value. The callback receives the changed computedValue, old and new value of computed object and an empty set of arguments.

#### Returns:
Type: `subscription`.
The subscription object that can be used to control the subscription.

### `computedValue.withArgs(...parameters)`
Returns the computed value object for the fixed set of parameters. `parameters` denote the set of arguments that will be used in `calculator` later.

#### Parameters:
* `parameters` *(varadic, any[])* - parameters that will be passed to the `calculator`. Calculator will be called with this set only once unless dependencies are changed. Trailing `undefined` values are dropped.

#### Returns:
Type: `computedForArgs`.
The computed value object for the given set of parameters.

### `computedValue.withNoArgs()`
Returns the computed value object for empty set of parameters.

#### Returns:
Type: `computedForArgs`.
The computed value object for empty set of parameters.

### `computedForArgs()`
Reads the current value of computed value object for the given set of parameters. `calculator` will be called if it is the first call or if a change was made to some of the dependencies (values/computeds) called from calculator previous time. Otherwise the cached current value will be returned.
During the call dependencies (values/computeds) used in the calculator will be recorded and stored in the list of dependencies.

#### Returns:
Type: `any`.
The current value of computed value object for the given parameters.

### `computedForArgs.write(newValue)`
Calls write callback for the computed passing selected arguments set.

#### Parameters:
* `newValue` *(mandatory, any value)* - the new value to write to computed object.

#### Returns:
Type: `void`.

### `computedForArgs.onChange(callback)`
Creates the subscription on a change to this computed value with the given set of arguments.

#### Parameters:
* `callback` *(mandatory, function (changed: computedValueForArgs, from: any, to: any, args: any[]) -> void )* - the function that will be called immediately when a change is made to one of dependencies that leads to a change of computed value. The callback receives the changed computedValue, old and new value of computed object and the given set of arguments.

#### Returns:
Type: `subscription`.
The subscription object that can be used to control the subscription.

### `itDepends.promiseValue(promise, initialValue)`

Creates promise value wrapper object.

#### Parameters:
* `promise` *(mandatory, [Promise](https://promisesaplus.com/#point-21))* - the promise object that is the source of the value.
* `initialValue` *(optional, any, undefined by default)* - the value to be stored in the promise value when created.

#### Returns:
Type: `promiseValue` (in fact the same as `computedForArgs`).
The promise value object filled with the `initialValue` or `undefined` if none specified.
Depending on the concrete Promise implementation can be filled with the value of a Promise if it was resolved already.

### `promiseValue()`
Reads the current value of promise value wrapper object.

#### Returns:
Type: `any`.
The current value of promise value wrapper object: `initialValue` of an object or the value that was used to resolve the Promise.

### `itDepends.onChange(callback)`
Creates the subscription on a change to any observable value.

#### Parameters:
* `callback` *(mandatory, function (changed: observableValue, from: any, to: any) -> void )* - the function that will be called immediately when a change is made to any observable value. The callback receives the changed observableValue, old and new value of observable object.

#### Returns:
Type: `subscription`.
The subscription object that can be used to control the subscription.

### `subscription.disable()`
Disables subscription, so change notifications will stop coming any more, unless it is enabled again with `enable` method.

#### Returns:
Type: `void`.

### `subscription.enable()`
Enables subscription if it was disabled previously, so change notifications will start coming again.

#### Returns:
Type: `void`.
